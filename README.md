# Version 1.7 - initial release
Complete rewrite to fix cookie problem with calling Nexus IQ server.
I have decided the best way to fix the security issues for now is to limit access to http://iq-server:8070. 
So you will have to alias your localhost as iq-server in your /etc/hosts/ file to use this plugin for now.
I will think about a change which gives access to all URLS like so below

Add "*://*/*" to permissions section like so

`"permissions": [
    "*://*/*",
 `   
    
This would then mean you would not need to alias Nexus IQ.
